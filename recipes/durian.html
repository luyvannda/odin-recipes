  <h2>What is Durian?</h2>
  <P id="durian-description">Durian fruit is the edible fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus "Durio".
    It is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and thorn-covered rind.
    It is commonly associated with Southeast Asian cuisine, especially in Indonesia,
    Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Bangladesh and Vietnam.
    Durian is native to Borneo and Sumatra, but it is also cultivated in Cambodia.
    There are three varieties of durian that are traditional in Cambodia:
    the "Ov Khak", "Sadong Kit" and "Dounta". These are similar to some Indonesian
    varieties of durian. Durian is one of the most popular fruits in Cambodia...
